Certainly! Here's a concise bullet-point guide to creating a Conda environment, activating it, and running the script:

1. **Create a Conda Environment:**
   - Create a new environment with Python 3.8 (or desired version):
     ```bash
     conda create --name env_name python=3.8
     ```

2. **Activate the Conda Environment:**
   - Activate the environment using:
     ```bash
     conda activate env_name
     ```

3. **Check Python Version (Optional):**
   - Verify the correct Python version:
     ```bash
     python --version
     ```

4. **Run the Script:**
   - With the environment activated, run the script:
     ```bash
     python src/image_to_base64.py images/ output output/README.md
     ```

5. **Deactivate the Conda Environment (Optional):**
   - Deactivate the environment when finished:
     ```bash
     conda deactivate
     ```

Note: Replace `env_name` with the desired name for your environment. Replace `images/` with the desired input directory. Replace `output` with the desired output directory. Replace `output/README.md` with the desired output file. The output file will be created if it does not already exist.
