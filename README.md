## Regional Analysis

### Africa
282 million people are experiencing hunger. East Africa faces deteriorating conditions, with 7.2 million at risk of starvation and 26.5 million facing acute food insecurity.

## Contributing Factors

### Seismic Hunger
A sudden, large-scale increase in hunger and food insecurity due to:

1. **Conflict and Economic Shocks:** Ukraine conflict's impact on food production and trade.
2. **Climate Change:** Repeated failing rains in East Africa, risking over 7 million lives.
3. **Soaring Food and Fuel Prices:** Global increases affecting food availability and affordability.
4. **COVID-19 Pandemic:** Lingering effects on global food supply chains.
